## Gallery

A tiny drop-in photo gallery with desktop, mobile, and high pixel density support.

Simply put the gallery.php file in any folder and it will display a gallery formatted to fit any screen, with some simple configurable options in the file.

This application requires the GD library for generation of thumbnails.
