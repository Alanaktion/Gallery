## Gallery

A tiny drop-in photo gallery with desktop, mobile, and high pixel density support.

Simply put the gallery.php file in any folder and it will display a gallery formatted to fit any screen, with some simple configurable options in the file.  You can also rename the file to whatever you desire, it will work as an index.php file.

This application requires the GD library for generation of thumbnails.
